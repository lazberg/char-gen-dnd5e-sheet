# Character Generator for D&D5e :game_die: 

As someone who plays a lot of Dungeons & Dragons, both as a player and as a dungeon master, I sometimes think how fun it would be to play a type of character I usually don't play! So as a practice to both my patience and my javaScript, I decided to make a character randomizer which would roll everything from race and class to equipment and backgrounds, in accordance with the core rulebook, Player's Handbook.

Using this generator, you'll have a fully playable character in a jiffy, and even be able to download a PDF of it!

## How To Use! :pencil:

### **[>>>access the github.io page here!<<<](https://lazberg.github.io/char-gen-dnd5e-sheet/)**

Just click "New Character" on the top to generate a new character.
The checkbox next to it will turn off ability descriptions which is nice for a more tidy sheet.
The save-button will save the sheet to a PDF using the naming convention "CharacterSheet_FirstnameLastname.pdf"

## Notes :book:

* The Ability Scores are rolled by using 4d6, removing the lowest value.
* The Ability Scores' top two values will sort themselves according to the classes, and then racial bonuses are added.
* The Personality boxes (Personality traits, Bonds, Flaws and Ideals) is from a much smaller pool that goes universal to all the backgrounds. This was simply because I didn't have the patience to manually insert all the background personalities.
* The Character Sheet PDF is originally from Wizards of the Coast, and is known to have some issues.
* The Character Sheet HTML-page was made using an online PDF-to-HTML converter, and might also prove to have some issues.
